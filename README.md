## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
Learnt how to use `display:grid`. Though this is a very basic appliction of the property, I used it to layout the bottom part of the component. Flexbox would have been another option, but what would you gain if you do not apply anything you learn.ðŸ˜‰

```css
 .bottom {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  }
```

### Useful resources
